# File Organizer
 Organizes the File in the Path you choose

This script first asks the user to select a folder. It then creates the necessary folders inside a folder named 'All Files'. After that, it loops over all files in the selected folder, checks the file extension, and moves the file into the corresponding folder inside 'All Files'. If a file has an extension not listed in your categories, it gets moved into the 'Other' folder.
